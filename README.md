# Hianime with Local MPV: CLI Anime Streamer for MPV & Custom Subs
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12-green)

## Description
A CLI Python tool for streaming anime from hianime.to using your local MPV player. Supports custom subtitle imports via Jimaku API‚Äîperfect for anime fans wanting a lightweight hianime MPV extension with multi-language subs and history tracking.

## Introduction
This code was mostly written with AI assistance. I just gave the idea for what to build, then handled some code tweaks and cleanup. It's great for importing subtitles in other languages and using MPV extensions for hianime.
