![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12-green)

## Description
A CLI Python tool for streaming anime from hianime.to using your local MPV player. Supports custom subtitle imports via Jimaku API‚Äîperfect for anime fans wanting a lightweight hianime MPV extension with multi-language subs and history tracking.

## Introduction
This code was mostly written with AI assistance. I just gave the idea for what to build, then handled some code tweaks and cleanup. It's great for people who want to importing subtitles in other languages and using MPV extensions for hianime.

## Enhancements
Pair this tool with these for an even better experience:

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- MPV player (install via [official site](https://mpv.io/)) and add to PATH.
- Key libraries (via `requirements.txt`): requests (for APIs), and beautifulsoup4 (for parsing). Full list in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/dhilzyi/hianime-with-local-mpv.git`
2. `cd hianime-with-local-mpv`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
```bash
python hianime.py
```
- Paste an anime URL (e.g., https://hianime.to/watch/one-piece-100).
- Select options like episode, or 'p' to pin to series.
- Choose servers manually or automatically.

## Troubleshooting
- Jimaku API issues: Get your key from jimaku.cc and add it to environment variables (e.g., export JIMAKU_API_KEY=yourkey) or paste directly in the code.
- MPV not launching? Ensure it's in your PATH (test with mpv --version).
